Engineers responsible for this project were:

* Bartosz Zator
Main contributor for this project. Created original code of BAS and FTDB processor. Technically and organizationally managed the project throughout its history.

* Krystian Kieczka
Developed low overhead version of the tracer based on Linux tracing infrastructure. Made the underlying tracing technology practically unnoticeable for most builds.

* Mateusz Mańko
Took over FTDB processor development. Substantially refactored existing code base and made groundwork for future FTDB support for C++ language.

* Paweł Wieczorek
Reworked post processing of clang compilation commands. Cut down the process from several hours to several minutes for entire Android platform build probably setting-up new world record in performance improvement over existing implementation.

However, the project wouldn't have been possible without the ideas, support and bug reports from:
Adrian Nieć - built entire infrastructure around the CAS which shaped all the existing (and non-existing) features of CAS.
Tomasz Kuchta - developed AoT project (https://github.com/Samsung/auto_off_target) which proved to be the best way of testing the entire CAS infrastructure.
